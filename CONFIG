# This is the config to know:
# 1- which files should simply be ignored
# 2- which files (more precisely, directories) should have their children
#    symlinked instead of themselves (e.g. for a directory like .config/foo, you
#    don't want to symlink .config directly in ~/ because it is probably used by
#    other applications. Instead, you want to symlink .config/foo inside
#    ~/.config)
# 3- all the other files will be symlinked directly in the home

# Ignore these
cfg_ignore=("CONFIG" "README.md" "bin" "todo"
            ".git" ".gitignore" ".gitmodules"
            "*.orig" "*.rej"
            ".*.swp" "*~" "\#*\#"
            ".DS_Store"
            "tags" "TAGS")

# As explained above, link what's inside
cfg_first_child=(".config")

# Destination: home directory
cfg_dest_dir="${HOME}"

# Relative path: if not set, use absolute path, otherwise, trust the user that
# the dotfiles directory is located at the given value relative to
# cfg_dest_dir.
# E.g: If cfg_dest_dir is /home/foo and the dotfiles directory is in
# /home/foo/git/dotfiles, then you should put "git/dotfiles" in there.
cfg_dotfiles_relative_path="git/dotfiles"
