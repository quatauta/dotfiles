# This is the config to know:
# 1- which files should simply be ignored
# 2- which files (more precisely, directories) should have their children
#    symlinked instead of themselves (e.g. for a directory like .config/foo, you
#    don't want to symlink .config directly in ~/ because it is probably used by
#    other applications. Instead, you want to symlink .config/foo inside
#    ~/.config)
# 3- which files should be copied such that changes get not tracked by vcs
# 4- all the other files will be symlinked directly in the home

# Ignore these
