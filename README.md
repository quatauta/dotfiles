Quatauta's dotfiles
===================

My collection of .rc files for Linux, mostly used on Gentoo/Linux systems.

The .rc files are managed with [thoughtbot's rcm](https://github.com/thoughtbot/rcm).

To use all these .rc files:

1. `git clone https://github.com/quatauta/dotfiles.git $HOME/.dotfiles`
1. `ln -s ~/.dotfiles/rcrc ~/.rcrc`
1. `lsrc -F`
1. `rcup`
