Quatauta's dotfiles
===================

My collection of dotfiles for Linux, mostly used on Gentoo/Linux systems. The dotfiles are
managed with [thoughtbot's rcm](https://github.com/thoughtbot/rcm).

To use all these dotfiles files:

1. `git clone https://github.com/quatauta/dotfiles.git $HOME/.dotfiles`
1. `ln -s ~/.dotfiles/rcrc ~/.rcrc`
1. `lsrc -F`
1. `rcup`
